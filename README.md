# FacialSyc
Android application could compute users' facial expression synchronization

For exchanging facial informations data, you should use our account: username: yaleishi@gmail.com / password: 1234567890 and perrysong@gmail.com / password: 1234567890 to test facial synchronization level.

Two devices should sign in at same time, and the sychronization value will be more accurate in the lastest signin device.

After sigin, both device should be able to detect face in front cameras, otherwise, the app will fail to compute the facial synchrony level.

To use our app, you should also include a google-services.json file in your android studio's app directory. The file I included in canvas.

Enjoy our Facial synchronization app! 
Cheers!
